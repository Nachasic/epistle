# OK GUYS
Looks like this damn thing is sorta working.

## There is nothing here to look at
Yet at least. Rigth now this is just a semi-sophisticated boilerplate for React-Typescript-SASS-Electron projects.
You go like:
```
yarn install && yarn start
```
And this hello-world appears on your screen as an electron app. And when you make changes in sourcecode, it refreshes. And you can test things with Jest (although there is nothing much to test).

Maybe someday I'll make something decent with this setup. Later, gater ðŸ˜˜
